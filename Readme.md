The information I gathered during my exploration  about Fine tuning is documented in the documentation.md file. I have  also attempted to demonstrate the fine-tuning process in the fine_tune_implementation.ipynb notebook using a GPT-2 model as an example. This implementation illustrates how to enhance the model's capabilities using a dataset of tweets along with their corresponding sentiments.
